      "\nFinancial Condition\n-------------------\nFor the three months ended January 1, 1994, net cash of $213.9 million was\nused by all operating activities, consisting of $90 million provided by\noperations, offset by $303.9 million used for net changes in receivables,\ninventories, payables and other items. Accounts receivable increased\nas a result of management's decision to discontinue an asset sale agreement\ndue to lower financing costs available through the sale of commercial paper.\nSee Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements.\nInventories increased slightly from 1993 fiscal year-end. Finished\ninventories have increased from 1993 fiscal year-end due to increased grain\ncosts, seasonal factors and shifts in product mix. Financing activities\nprovided net cash of $255.4 million, mainly from the discontinuance of the\nsale of accounts receivable and additional long-term debt incurred by issuing\ncommercial paper. The Company used funds generated from operating activities\nand financing activities to fund $44.4 million of property, plant and\nequipment additions. The expenditures for property, plant and equipment were\nrelated to new equipment and upgrading facilities to take advantage of market\nopportunities and the Company's continuing effort to increase efficiencies,\nreduce overall cost, and meet or exceed environmental standards.\n\nAt January 1, 1994, working capital was $577.6 million compared to\n$285.1 million at 1993 fiscal year-end, an increase of $292.5 million. The\ncurrent ratio at the end of the first quarter of 1994 was 2.13 to 1 compared\nto 1.54 to 1 at 1993 fiscal year-end. The current ratio for the first\nquarter was impacted by management's decision to discontinue the sale of\naccounts receivable and increase commercial paper borrowings to achieve lower\nfinancing costs. See Note 2 to Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial\nStatements.\n\nThe Company's foreseeable cash needs for operations and capital expenditures\nwill continue to be met through cash flows from operations and borrowings\nsupported by existing credit facilities and additional credit facilities\nwhich the Company believes are available.\n\nLong-term debt has increased $245 million since 1993 fiscal year-end. This\nis due to the Company's discontinuance of the sale of accounts receivable in\nthe amount of $275 million, and the financing of this amount through the sale\nof commercial paper. At January 1, 1994, long-term debt was 45.3% of total\ncapitalization compared to 40.3% at 1993 fiscal year-end. On December 17,\n1993, the Company obtained a $150 million unsecured revolving credit\nagreement. This credit agreement plus the Company's two other unsecured\nrevolving credit agreements totaling $850 million provide the Company access\nto $1 billion which supports the Company's commercial paper program. At\nJanuary 1, 1994, long-term debt consisted of $590 million of commercial\npaper, $167 million drawn under the revolving credit facilities, $366 million\nof institutional notes and $42.5 million of other indebtedness.\n\nResults of Operations\n---------------------\nSales for the first quarter of 1994 increased 6.4% over the same quarter of\n1993. This increase was mainly due to an increase in consumer poultry sales\nwhich accounted for 6.1% of the increase in 1994 total sales. The increase\nin consumer poultry sales is attributable to a 9.3% increase in tonnage\noffset slightly by a 1.1% decrease in sales prices. First quarter sales to\nthe animal and pet food industry increased 1994 total sales by 0.2% compared\nto the first quarter of last year due to a 5.9% increase in tonnage and a\n2.8% increase in sales prices. Beef and pork sales increased first quarter\n1994 total sales by 4.2% compared to 1993. Beef and pork sales increased\nprimarily due to production by the new pork operation in Marshall, Missouri.\nSeafood sales decreased first quarter 1994 total sales 2.0% due to a 22.0%\ndecrease in tonnage and a 14.8% decrease in average sales prices. Seafood\nsales volumes and profit margins continue to be adversely affected by various\nfactors including changes in product mix resulting from government fishing\nquotas, resource availability and fluctuations in market prices. Mexican\nfood, prepared foods and other sales decreased first quarter 1994 total sales\nby 0.1%. Reduced numbers of live swine sales resulted in a decrease to 1994\ntotal sales by 2.0% compared to first quarter 1993 swine sales. This\ndecrease in live swine sales was primarily the result of the integration of\nsome of the live swine production with the Company's swine processing\nfacility.\n\nThe increase in cost of goods sold of 6.5% for the first quarter of 1994\ncompared to the same quarter of 1993 was mainly the result of the increase in\nsales plus an increase of approximately 7.1% in feed ingredient costs. As a\npercent of sales, cost of sales was 81.1% for both the first quarter of 1994\nand the first quarter of 1993. While the Company's strategy of adding value\nto products through further-processing offsets a portion of the impact of\nhigher grain costs, such increases continue to affect poultry, swine and\nMexican food production cost. Additionally, management expects feed\ningredient costs for poultry and swine production to increase approximately\n9% during the second quarter of fiscal 1994. It is anticipated that the\nincrease in these costs will have an adverse impact on second quarter results\nand will continue to have an adverse impact on operating results until such\ntime as the market will permit these costs to be passed through to customers.\nThe Company monitors and compares costs for labor, raw material purchases,\nutilities and other expenses to companies within the industry as part of its\ncost control measures and believes such costs are at least within industry\naverages.\n\nEnvironmental Matters\n---------------------\nThe Company has a strong financial commitment to environmental matters.\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal 1994 the Company invested approximately\n$1.7 million in water quality facilities, including both capital outlays to\nbuild and upgrade facilities and $7.2 million for day-to-day operations.\n",

      "text": "During the first quarter of fiscal 1994, the Registrant reported a modest increase in deficit operating cash flows, recording a shortfall of $0.3 million compared to $0.2 million in the same quarter of the prior year. Capital expenditures totaled $1.6 million, primarily used for hotel renovations (six hotels) and television upgrades (seven hotels), with funding derived from installment sales contracts ($0.6M), restricted cash deposits ($0.5M), and operating cash flow ($0.5M). While total revenues declined by $1.0 million—driven largely by a decrease in hotel gross revenues and the effect of disposing of two hotels—key performance indicators such as room revenue, occupancy, and average daily room rates (ADR) showed improvements. Operating costs and expenses fell by $1.8 million, partly due to the divestiture of certain assets and reduced car wash operations. Interest expenses remained relatively flat at approximately $2.4 million, and a change in income tax accounting (from the deferred to the liability method) resulted in a net tax credit of 34.04%, up from 31.24% in the prior year."

      "text": "For the periods ending December 31, 1993, UM&M experienced a notable decline in consolidated net sales largely due to the sale or termination of certain operations. On a comparable basis, excluding these discontinued operations, net sales were relatively stable—with a modest increase in the quarter and a slight decline over six months. Within the apparel textiles segment, the yarn operation benefited from increased unit sales (despite lower selling prices) while the greige fabrics operation faced challenges such as decreased demand and product discontinuations. Overall operating losses narrowed compared to the previous year, driven in part by improved margins in greige fabrics, although these gains were offset by one-time charges in the yarn operation and widening losses in the apparel (retail) and accessories segments. Interest expense increased slightly due to higher average borrowings under the revolving loan agreements. On the liquidity side, persistent operational losses, a stockholders’ equity deficit, and significant indebtedness to its factor (approximately $106.5 million) raise substantial concerns about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern. However, the Company is actively pursuing strategies to reduce its indebtedness through targeted repayment agreements and potential asset sales, which may help stabilize its financial position."

A replacement of its $100 million revolving credit facility with more favorable terms further supports its balance sheet. Current assets and liabilities increased notably due to seasonal expansions in domestic tobacco operations. In operations, while sales and gross profits declined in key segments—impacted by lower domestic tobacco demand, quality issues, and adverse market conditions—offsetting gains were seen in foreign tobacco and agri-product segments. Higher SG&A expenses, one-time charges related to SFAS 106, and rising interest expense from inventory costs and the Casalee acquisition have added pressure, although lower interest rates and an improved effective tax rate (32% vs. 35%) have helped moderate costs. Amid ongoing industry uncertainties, including domestic legislative changes and global oversupply concerns, the company remains cautiously optimistic about long-term market improvements."

    "summary": {
      "text": "In the first quarter of fiscal 1994, Valspar Corp delivered solid operational performance with a 7.9% sales increase—up $10.8 million from the comparable quarter of 1993—driven by higher volume in the Consumer, Industrial, McWhorter Resin, and Special Groups. Although the Packaging Group experienced a decline due to competitive pricing pressures, overall gross profit margins improved from 25.3% to 26.6% as a result of enhanced productivity, better capacity utilization, and lower raw material costs. Operating expenses rose by 5.2% ($1.48 million) largely due to increased direct selling costs, yet they declined as a percentage of sales (from 20.9% to 20.3%). Lower average borrowings and reduced interest rates contributed to a drop in interest expense, while a $2.47 million write-down of a resin plant was recorded. The combined effects of these factors resulted in a 25.7% increase in net income compared to the prior year. Financially, the company's total debt to capital ratio increased from 5.83% at year-end 1993 to 9.78% at the end of Q1, and working capital (excluding cash and notes payable) grew from $85.86 million to nearly $100 million, reflecting normal seasonal increases. Capital expenditures nearly doubled, driven by the acquisition of a $3 million distribution center in Statesville, North Carolina. Additionally, on February 18, 1994, the wholly-owned resin subsidiary, McWhorter, Inc., completed its acquisition of Cargill's Resin Products Division and restructured its operations, supported by a new $60 million revolving credit facility."
