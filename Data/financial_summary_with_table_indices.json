        "text": "For the three months ended January 1, 1994, the company reported net operating cash outflows of $213.9 million, driven by a $303.9 million increase in receivables and inventories, offset by $90 million provided by operations. Financing activities provided $255.4 million, mainly from increased commercial paper issuance. Working capital rose to $577.6 million, improving the current ratio to 2.13:1. Long-term debt increased by $245 million, reaching 45.3% of total capitalization, supported by $1 billion in revolving credit facilities. Sales grew 6.4%, driven by higher poultry sales, but higher feed costs (7.1%) and expected 9% cost increases in Q2 may impact margins. Interest expense fell 10% due to lower rates."
